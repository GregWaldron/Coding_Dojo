1. What query would you run to get the total revenue for March of 2012?
SELECT sum(amount) AS march_2012_sales FROM billing WHERE charged_datetime >= '2012/03/01' AND charged_datetime < '2012/04/01';

2. What query would you run to get total revenue collected from the client with an id of 2?
SELECT sum(amount) FROM billing
JOIN clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 2;

3. What query would you run to get all the sites that client with an id of 10 owns?
SELECT domain_name FROM sites
JOIN clients ON sites.client_id = clients.client_id
WHERE clients.client_id = 10;

4. What query would you run to get total # of sites created per month per year for the client with an id of 1? What about for client with an id of 20?
SELECT COUNT(domain_name), MONTH(created_datetime), YEAR(created_datetime) FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 1
GROUP BY YEAR(created_datetime), MONTH(created_datetime);

SELECT COUNT(domain_name), MONTH(created_datetime), YEAR(created_datetime) FROM sites
WHERE client_id = 20
GROUP BY YEAR(created_datetime), MONTH(created_datetime);

5. What query would you run to get the total # of leads generated for each of the sites between January 1, 2011 to February 15, 2011?
SELECT COUNT(leads.leads_id), sites.domain_name FROM leads
RIGHT JOIN sites ON leads.site_id = sites.site_id
WHERE leads.registered_datetime >= '2011.01.01' AND leads.registered_datetime <= '2011/02/15'
GROUP BY sites.site_id;

6. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011?
SELECT clients.first_name, clients.last_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS 2011_lead_total FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id 
LEFT JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
GROUP BY clients.client_id;

7. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each client each month between months 1 - 6 of Year 2011?
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client, MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) AS month, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS lead_total FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id 
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011 AND MONTH(leads.registered_datetime) IN (1,2,3,4,5,6)
GROUP BY clients.client_id, MONTH(leads.registered_datetime);

8. What query would you run to get a list of client names and the total # of leads we've generated for each of our clients' sites between January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2011? Order this query by client id.  Come up with a second query that shows all the clients, the site name(s), and the total number of leads generated from each site for all time.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS lead_total FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id 
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
WHERE YEAR(leads.registered_datetime) = 2011
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.site_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name;

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client, sites.domain_name, COUNT(leads.leads_id) AS lead_total FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id 
JOIN leads ON sites.site_id = leads.site_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id, sites.site_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id, sites.domain_name;

9. Write a single query that retrieves total revenue collected from each client for each month of the year. Order it by client id.  First try this with integer month, second with month name.  A SELECT subquery will be needed for the second challenge.  Look at this for a hint.
SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, SUM(billing.amount) AS total_revenue, MONTH(billing.charged_datetime) AS month_charged, YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS year_charged FROM billing
JOIN clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY YEAR(billing.charged_datetime), MONTH(billing.charged_datetime), clients.client_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id, billing.charged_datetime;

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, SUM(billing.amount) AS total_revenue, MONTHNAME(billing.charged_datetime) AS month_charged, YEAR(billing.charged_datetime) AS year_charged FROM billing
JOIN clients ON billing.client_id = clients.client_id
GROUP BY YEAR(billing.charged_datetime), MONTH(billing.charged_datetime), clients.client_id
ORDER BY clients.client_id, billing.charged_datetime;

10. Write a single query that retrieves all the sites that each client owns. Group the results so that all of the sites for each client are displayed in a single field. It will become clearer when you add a new field called 'sites' that has all the sites that the client owns. (HINT: use GROUP_CONCAT)

SELECT CONCAT(clients.first_name, ' ', clients.last_name) AS client_name, GROUP_CONCAT(sites.domain_name) FROM clients
LEFT JOIN sites ON clients.client_id = sites.client_id
GROUP BY clients.client_id;
